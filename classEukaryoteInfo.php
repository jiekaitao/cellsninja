    <summary>Cell Membrane</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>The most basic form of protection in cells remains semi-permeable to allow vital materials to pass through itself in order to provide the cell with the materials critical to its survival.</p>
    </div>
  </details>

    <details>
    <summary>Golgi apparatus</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>The golgi apparatus is exclusive to eukaryotic cells. The golgi consist of stacks of flat membranous sacs that modify, store, and route products of the endoplasmic reticulum (proteins) and synthesize products such as non cellulose carbohydrates.</p>
    </div>
  </details>


  <details>
    <summary>Ribosomes</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>Required by both classes of cells, ribosomes’ primary function is to convert genetic code into amino acid sequences and build protein polymers from amino acid monomers; this is a process known as protein synthesis or translation.  Ribosomes can either be found in the cytosol known as free ribosomes, or they can be found in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the protein they synthesize can be excreted from the cell.</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Flagella</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>The flagella is available to both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.  The flagella’s primary function is to provide mobility to the cells also known as chemotaxis.  </p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Smooth ER</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>The smooth endoplasmic reticulum (smooth ER) is required for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The primary function of the smooth ER is to synthesize lipids and phospholipids as in plasma membranes, and steroids,metabolize carbohydrates, detoxify poison, and store calcium.</p>
    </div>
  </details>


  <details>
    <summary>Rough ER</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>The rough endoplasmic reticulum (rough ER) is required by both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.  Dotted with ribosomes, the rough ER is responsible for the synthesis of secretory proteins.  These are proteins, like the name suggests, that are secreted by the golgi apparatus to be used for out of cell functions.</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Lysosomes</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>Lysosomes are only available to eukaryotic cells, as they are single membrane bound sacs.  The lysosome is often considered the “recycler” of the cell, as they decompose cellular waste such as macromolecules, into their monomers to be used by other organelles.  An example of this is the breaking down of glycogen into glucose.</p>
    </div>
  </details>



  <details>
    <summary>Chloroplast</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>The chloroplast is available to the eukaryotic class only, specifically plant cells.  The chloroplast converts light energy into relatively stable chemical energy via the photosynthetic process, similar to the mitochondria.  Within the chloroplast, there is chlorophyll which is responsible for absorbing light and channels it to be converted, as well as giving plants their color.</p>
    </div>
  </details>



  <details>
    <summary>Mitochondrion</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>The mitochondrion is available to the eukaryotic class only, specifically animal cells, responsible for synthesizing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) energy.  The membrane is composed of a phospholipid bilayer that is embedded with proteins, the innermost membrane is what contains the mitochondrial matrix which is where the Krebs cycle takes place.  </p>
    </div>
  </details>



  <details>
    <summary>Nucleus</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>Only available for the eukaryotic cell class, the nucleus is protected by a two lipid bilayer known as the nuclear envelope scattered with pores to allow for vital materials through.  The nucleus acts as the control center for the cell, controlling all functions of the cell, such as metabolism, growth, and also houses all genetic material.  The nucleus also contains a nucleolus, which synthesizes rRNA and ribosomes.</p>
    </div>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Cell Wall</summary>
    <div class="faq__content">
      <p>Provides extra protection to most prokaryotic and specific eukaryotic cells. This is an upgrade to the Cell membrane, as it attaches itself to the outside of the membrane.</p>
